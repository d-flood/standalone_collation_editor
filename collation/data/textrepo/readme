A directory here named `json` will contain witness directories; 
each witness directory will contain all individual verse transcriptions 
files for that witness. My naming convention is to name the witness 
directories after their Gregory-Aland numbers. This keeps things simpler 
when generating JSON transcription files and directories programmatically 
(i.e., the `siglum` value is saving a lot of work).
